      <h1>REST API and Express</h1>
      <hr />
      <p>
        For this project I have set up a REST API and used to Express along with
        Node.js to simplify and streamline it.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>REST API</h2>
      <p>
        A REST API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming
        Interface) is a set of rules and conventions for building and
        interacting with web services. It uses standard HTTP methods like GET,
        POST, PUT, DELETE to perform actions on resources. REST APIs enable
        communication between different applications over the internet allowing
        them to request and exchange data in a consistent and predictable
        manner. REST APIs are commonly used for web application development
        providing a way to get, create, update, and delete (CRUD) data on remote
        servers.
        <br />
        There are two important conventions to following when designing a REST
        API.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Ordering of HTTP methods</li>
        <li>Endpoints should reflect the underlying collections</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Example:</p>
      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>HTTP method</th>
            <th>Endpoint</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tr>
          <td>GET</td>
          <td>/movies</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>GET</td>
          <td>/movies/{id}</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>POST</td>
          <td>/movies</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>PATCH</td>
          <td>/movies/{id}</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>PUT</td>
          <td>/movies/{id}</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>DELETE</td>
          <td>/movies/{id}</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>
        Here the different endpoints all refer to a collection server side.
        Because it is a collection it is assumed that there are multiple objects
        it movie in plural. When referencing a specific object an id, name or
        some other unique property of the object is needed to find and identify
        it so that it can be handled properly according to specific endpoint
        that is called.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>Express</h2>
      <p>
        Express.js is a web application framework with Node.js in the
        development of web applications and APIs. In the project I use for:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Routing: Easy definition of routes for handling different HTTP
          requests.
        </li>
        <li>
          Middleware: Integration of middleware functions for tasks like data
          parsing and authentication.
        </li>
        <li>
          Port Handling: Management of server ports for listening to incoming
          requests.
        </li>
        <li>
          Static File Serving: Efficient serving of static files like HTML, CSS,
          and JavaScript.
        </li>
        <li>JSON Parsing: Built-in support for handling JSON data.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Example of CRUD:</strong> Below is an example of full CRUD REST
        API I made for this project.
      </p>
      <pre class="pre">
            <code class="javascript">

                app.get("/movies", (req, res) => {
                    res.send(getMovies());
                  });
                  
                  app.get("/movies/:name", (req, res) => {
                    const movieName = req.params.name;
                    const formattedMovieName = movieName.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + movieName.slice(1).toLowerCase();
                    res.send(getMovie(formattedMovieName));
                  });
                  
                  app.post("/movies", (req, res) => {
                    const newMovie = req.body;
                    if (!newMovie || !newMovie.name || !newMovie.prodYear) {
                      res.send({ error: "Missing mountain data." });
                      return;
                    }
                  
                    const addedMovie = addMovie(newMovie);
                  
                    if (addedMovie.error) {
                      res.status(404).send({ error: "No movie with that name." });
                    } else {
                      res.send(addedMovie);
                    }
                  });
                  
                  app.patch("/movies/:name", (req, res) => {
                    const movieName = req.params.name;
                    const formattedMovieName = movieName.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + movieName.slice(1).toLowerCase();
                    const movieToUpdate = req.body;
                  
                    if (!movieToUpdate || !movieToUpdate.name || !movieToUpdate.prodYear) {
                      res.send({ error: "Missing movie data." });
                      return;
                    }
                  
                    const updatedMovie = updateMovie(formattedMovieName, movieToUpdate);
                  
                    if (updatedMovie.error) {
                      res.status(404).send({ error: "No movie with that name." });
                    } else {
                      res.send(updatedMovie);
                    }
                  });
            </code>
            </pre>
      <p>
        As you can see it use the conventions mentioned earlier and handles
        errors that may occur during or with the correspondance.
        <br />
        Below are examples of methods from Express used to build and support the API.
      </p>
      <pre class="pre">
        <code class="javascript">
            // This is a method provided by Express to enable JSON parsing for incoming requests.
            // It allows your application to handle JSON data in the request body.
            app.use(express.json());

            // This method serves static files from the "public" directory making them accessible to clients.
            // It's used to serve things like HTML, CSS, JavaScript files, images and other static assets.
            // It's an important security measure because it helps prevent unauthorized access to your static files.
            app.use(express.static("public"));


            // This is a method provided by Express to start your server and listen on a specified port.
            // In this example it sets up the Express application to listen to port 8080.
            // When a client makes a request to this port the Express server will handle it. 
            const PORT = 8080;
            app.listen(PORT);
        </code>
      </pre>

      <br />
      <h2>Try the CRUD:</h2>
      <p>
        Below is a table using the GET /movies endpoint. The list (array) with
        movies is fetched and put into a table.
      </p>
      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Movie name</th>
            <th>Genre</th>
            <th>Production year</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody id="table"></tbody>
      </table>
      <br />
      <hr>
      <p>
        <strong>GET: </strong>Here you can use the input field to fetch from the
        GET /movies/{name} endpoint. It is set up to search by name of the movie
        on the list of movies. It could also have been ID it makes a bit more
        sense to search movies by name than som random generated ID.
      </p>
      <input id="getMovie" type="text" />
      <br />
      <button id="getMovieBtn">Get movie data</button>
      <div id="fetchedMovie"></div>
      <br />
      <hr>
      <p>
        <strong>POST: </strong>Below you can add a new movie to the list by
        sending request to POST /movies endpoint. Just enter the input fields.
        When the request has been handled susccesfully, the table containing all
        movies on the list will be updated.
      </p>
      <input type="text" id="postName" placeholder="Name of new movie" />
      <br />
      <input type="text" id="postGenre" placeholder="Genre of new movie" />
      <br />
      <input
        type="number"
        id="postProdYear"
        placeholder="Production year of new movie"
      />
      <br />
      <button id="postMovieBtn">Post new movie</button>
      <p id="response-message-post"></p>
      <hr>
      <p>
        <strong>PATCH: </strong>Below you can get an existing movie by the name
        by typing it in the name field and clicking the "get movie data" button.
        From there you get all the data on the movie and can change (update) it
        as you like (except id). After clicking the "Update movie" button you
        can see the changes in the table further up. It uses the PATCH
        /movies/{id} endpoint.
      </p>
      <strong>Id: </strong>
      <p id="movieId"></p>
      <input type="text" id="patchName" placeholder="Name of movie" />
      <button id="getPatchMovieBtn">Get movie data</button>
      <br />
      <input type="text" id="patchGenre" placeholder="Genre of movie" />
      <br />
      <input
        type="number"
        id="patchProdYear"
        placeholder="Production year of movie"
      />
      <br />
      <button id="patchMovieBtn">Update movie</button>
      <p id="response-message-patch"></p>
      <br />
      <p>
        <hr>
        <strong>DELETE: </strong>Below you can delete movies bu inputting the name of the movie. It uses the endport PATCH /movies/{name}. As before the table updates when the movie is deleted.
      </p>
      <input type="text" id="deleteMovie">
      <br />
      <button id="deleteMovieBtn">Delete movie</button>
