      <p>
        This is simply a walkthrough of some few rules of thumb for HTML and
        CSS.
      </p>

      <h2>Styling</h2>
      <p>In HTML, there are three methods for managing styling:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Inline styles:</strong> Styling is applied to a specific
          element. Can be set with style.
          <ul>
            <li>Best suited for small projects.</li>
            <li>No reusability</li>
            <li>
              Specificity: Can override styles defined in external stylesheet
              which can be both a pro and a con.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Styles defined within the HTML file: </strong> Styling is
          defined at the top of the HTML document with the style element ul.
          <ul>
            <li>
              Best used for specific styling in one HTML document because it
              can't be shared between different documents.
            </li>
            <li>Best suited for smaller projects.</li>
            <li>
              Can override external linked stylesheets but be overridden by
              inline styling.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>External styles linked via link: </strong>Styling is done in a
          separate CSS-file and the HTML document used the link element to
          access it.
          <ul>
            <li>
              High reusability because it can easily be accessed by multiple
              HTML documents.
            </li>
            <li>Easy refactoring.</li>
            <li>Helps keep cleaner code and better organization of project.</li>
            <li>
              External stylesheets are cached by web browsers which can improve
              page loading times for returning visitors. Browsers only need to
              download the stylesheet once and can reuse it for subsequent
              pages.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Circular dependency</h2>
      <p>
        When using scripts in HTML you should be aware of problems that might
        occur with circular dependency. Circular dependency occurs when two
        JavaScript files depend on each other's functionality, creating issues
        with code maintainability and execution.
        <br />
        This can be avoided by refactoring code to break the circular dependency
        by combining, modularizing or using event-based communication between
        scripts. Make sure to list the scripts in correct order in the HTML
        document.
