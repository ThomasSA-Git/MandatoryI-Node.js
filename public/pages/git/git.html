        Git is a version control system that helps us manage our project during
        development. A lot of IDEs have their own VCS but for the project git
        has been used.
        <br />
        Below you will see some examples of some of the commands used with git bash.

      <pre class="pre">
        <code>
            // Initializes a new Git repository in the current directory.
            $ git init

            // Stages all changes in the current directory for the next commit.
            $ git add .

            // Commits changes made to the repository with a descriptive commit message.
            $ git commit -m "commit message"

            // Creates a copy of a remote repository on your local machine.
            $ git clone https://github.com/username/repo.git

            // To add a remote repository and give it a name (in this case "origin"):
            $ git remote add origin remote_repository_url

            // To update your local references of remote repository
            $ git fetch

            // Uploads committed changes to a remote repository.
            $ git push

            // Fetches changes from a remote repository and merges them into the current branch.
            $ git pull

            // Creates new branch (called feature-branch here)
            $ git branch feature-branch

            //  Switches to a different branch (feature-branch here)
            $ git checkout feature-branch

            // Deletes branch
            $ git branch -d feature-branch

            // How to merge branch
            // First switch to the target branch (here master is used as example)
            $ git checkout master

            // Then, merge the feature branch (feature-branch) into master
            $ git merge feature-branch
