      <h1>Functions</h1>
      <hr />
      <p>
        A JavaScript function is a reusable block of code that performs a
        specific task(s). Functions can take inputs (parameters) and can return
        a result. They are essential for organizing and reusing code in
        JavaScript.
        <br />
        There are several different types of functions and ways to write them.
        Below are a few examples of them.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        <strong>Regular function: </strong>A regular function is defined using
        the function keyword. It has a function name and can be called using
        that name.
      </p>
      <pre class="pre">
            <code class="javascript">
                function regularFunction(param) {
                    return param * 2;
                }                
            </code>
        </pre>
      <br />
      <p>
        <strong>Arrow function: </strong> Arrow functions have shorter syntax
        for writing functions. They are commonly used for simple, one-liner
        functions.
      </p>
      <pre class="pre">
            <code class="javascript">
                // Arrow function with return.
                const arrowFunctionWithReturn = (param) => {
                    return param * 2;
                };
                
                // Arrow function with one-line return.
                const arrowFunction = (param) => param * 2;

            </code>
        </pre>
      <br />
      <p>
        <strong>Anonymous function: </strong> Anonymous functions do not have a
        name and are often used as callbacks or assigned to variables. They can
        be defined using the function keyword without a name. They are often
        used in eventlisteners.
      </p>
      <pre class="pre">
            <code class="javascript">
                const anonymousFunction = function(param) {
                    return param * 2;
                };
            </code>
        </pre>
      <br />
      <p>
        <strong>Callback function: </strong> Callback functions are functions
        passed as arguments to other functions to be executed at a later time or
        under specific conditions. They are commonly used for asynchronous
        operations or event handling.
      </p>
      <pre class="pre">
            <code class="javascript">
                // A callback function called doubleValue that doubles a given value.
                function doubleValue(param) {
                    return param * 2;
                }

                // The performOperation function that takes a value and a callback.
                function performOperation(value, callback) {
                // Inside performOperation the callback function can be called with the value as its argument.
                const result = callback(value);

                return result;
                }

                // Call performOperation with the value 5 and the doubleValue callback.
                const result = performOperation(5, doubleValue);
            </code>
