        SSR is a web development technique where the 
        server generates the HTML content for a web 
        page and sends it to the client, allowing the 
        browser to render the page more quickly than
        Client-side Rendering (CSR).
        <br />
        Here's a short break down of SSR:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The server generates the HTML content for a web page.</li>
        <li>The fully rendered HTML is sent to the client.</li>
        <li>The browser can directly render the page based on the received HTML.</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <p>
        SSR gives a faster page load by 
        sending pre-rendered HTML from the server. 
        CSR involves additional client-side 
        processing before rendering can occur which 
        takes longer.
        This is imporant because:

            Instant Content for Crawlers: SSR delivers 
            fully rendered HTML to search 
            engines upfront making quicker and more 
            accurate indexing compared to CSR.
        </li>
        <li>
            Efficient Crawling: SSRs server-generated 
            HTML allows web crawlers to swiftly analyze 
            and index content. This enhances SEO by providing 
            a more efficient crawling process.
