    <h1>Server-side Rendering</h1>

        SSR is a web development technique where the 
        server generates the HTML content for a web 
        page and sends it to the client, allowing the 
        browser to render the page more quickly than
        Client-side Rendering (CSR).
        <br />
        Here's a short break down of SSR:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The server generates the HTML content for a web page.
            Only generates once and thats when server is started.
        </li>
        <li>The fully rendered HTML is sent to the client.</li>
        <li>The browser can directly render the page based on the received HTML.</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <p>
        SSR gives a faster page load by 
        sending pre-rendered HTML from the server. 
        CSR involves additional client-side 
        processing before rendering can occur which 
        takes longer.
        This is imporant because:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Instant content for crawlers: SSR delivers 
            fully rendered HTML to search 
            engines upfront making quicker and more 
            accurate indexing compared to CSR.
        </li>
        <li>
            Efficient crawling: SSRs server-generated 
            HTML allows web crawlers to quickly analyze 
            and index content. This enhances SEO by providing 
            a more efficient crawling process.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Below I will show step by step how I've used it for the home page for this website.</p>
    <pre class="pre">
        <code class="javascript">

            // Below is the templateEngine.
            import fs from "fs";

            export function pageToString(filePath) {
                return fs.readFileSync(filePath).toString();
            }

            export function renderPage(page) {
                const navbar = fs.readFileSync("./public/components/navbar/navbar.html").toString();

                return navbar + page;
            }
        </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
        The functions above are in a module serving as a template engine, and 
        handling the rendering of the page.
        It pieces it together with the parts needed to make the requested page.
        In my project it simply adds the navbar to the base HTML of the page.
        This is just an example, but more parts could be added, such as a footer.
        <br />
        Doing it this way makes it easier to reuse and refactor parts of the page
        that is needed on several pages.
        <br />
        File system (fs) is imported. It is needed to use readFileSync which reads
        the files synchronously as opposed to readFile which is asynchronous. Doing
        it synchronously is preferred while rendering.
        <br />
    </p>
    <pre class="pre">
        <code class="javascript">

            // Turning html file to string with function from previous example.
            const home = pageToString('./public/pages/home/home.html');

            // Exporting the rendered page.
            export const homePage = renderPage(home);

            // Endpoint for routing to the home page.
            app.get("/", (req, res) => {
                res.send(homePage);
              });
        </code>
    </pre>
    <p>Above the rest of the process is showed. Now the page will show with 
        the intended content including navbar when routing to it with "/".</p>
