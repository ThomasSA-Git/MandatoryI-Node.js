      <h1>Node.js</h1>
      <hr />
      <p>
        Node.js is an open-source runtime enviroment that makes it possible to
        execute JavaScript outside a webbrowser. In this project it is used for
        the server side. It gives access to a variety of libraries and packages
        through npm (node package manager).
        <br />
        As with other package managers such as maven or graddle, npm handles
        dependencies. An important part of Node.js projects is the package.json
        file. It contains metadata about the project and its dependecies.
        <br />
        Below is a simple example of this with express listed as a dependency.
        The needed libaries can be installed easily using npm in the terminal.
      </p>

      <pre class="pre">
        <code class="javascript">
            {
                "dependencies": {
                    "express": "4.18.2"
                }
            }
        </code>
        </pre>
      <p>
        Below are the commands needed to install express. Simliar dependencies
        can be installed the same way by just switching express with the name of
        needed dependency. That will install the newest version.
      </p>
      <pre class="pre">
            <code class="javascript">
                // Examples of commands to use in the terminal
                $ npm i express
                // Or
                $ npm install express
            </code>
            </pre>
      <p>
        Installing this will create the package-lock.json file that manages
        dependencies. It ensures that dependency management is reliable and
        consistent by:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Dependency version locking: Locks too specific versions of all
          packages. That ensures you get the exact same versions each time you
          or someone else install so that there are no unexpected updates or
          changes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Dependency tree: Shows how different packages depend on eachoter.
        </li>
        <li>
          Reproducibility: Makes it reproducable over different enviroments and
          installations. This gives a consistent development and deployment
          process.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <p>
        As mentioned earlier the package.json can hold other metadata about the
        project besides the dependencies. These can be added from the terminal
        with the command below.
      </p>
      <pre class="pre">
            <code class="javascript">
                $ npm init
            </code>
        </pre>
      <p>
        This will give you the option to add additional info about the project.
        Se below for example.

      <p>
        As you see there are several details added to the package above. A
        detail worth of notice that was added manually is type. By default it is
        CommonJS but here it is set to module. This affects how how you import
        and export code from other files and also how it is loaded.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>CommonJS uses require and module.exports.</li>
        <li>Modules (ES6) uses import/export.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        CommonJS is often used serverside whereas Modules is used both server
        and clientside. Using modules can help make the code better organized
        and more efficient.
      </p>

      <pre class="pre">
            <code class="javascript">
                // Example of import using Modules
                import { getExampleObject } from "./objectCreator.js";
                
                // Example of export using Modules
                export default {
                    getExampleObject,
                    addExampleObject

                }
                // Or
                export const exampleValue = "example";


                // Example of import using CommonJS
                const objectCreator = require("./objectCreator.js");

                // Example of export using CommonJS
                module.exports = {
                    getExampleObject,
                    addExampleObject

      <h2>Nodemon</h2>
      <p>
        Nodemon is a utility for Node.js applications that automatically
        monitors changes in your project files and restarts your server when
        changes are detected. It simplifies the development process so that you
        don't need to manually stop and restart your application each time you
        make code changes.
        <br />
        Below you can see the command to install it.
      </p>
      <pre class="pre">
            <code class="javascript">
                $ npm install -g nodemon
            </code>
            </pre>
      <p>There are some pros and cons to consider when using it.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Pros:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Automatic restart: Nodemon automatically restarts your application
            when code changes reducing downtime during development.
          </li>
          <li>
            Improved productivity: It streamlines the development process so
            that you don't need to manually stop and restart the server after
            code modifications.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Cons:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Resource intensive: Nodemon continuously watches for file changes
            which can consume system resources. For small projects this
            shouldn't be an issue.
          </li>
          <li>
            Not suitable for all scenarios: While Nodemon is good for
            development it may not be suitable for production environments where
            code changes should be carefully controlled.
          </li>
        </ul>
